LUMOS AI Lab (AI for Urban Mobility & Societal Sciences) at Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, was founded by Assistant Professor Xiao Zhou. The lab is dedicated to advancing cutting-edge AI research to empower social development. You can find us on WeChat by searching “LUMOS熠智AI-Lab.”
The name “LUMOS” is inspired by the spell “Lumos” from Harry Potter, used to light up a wizard’s wand. In the same spirit, we aspire to use the “magic” of AI to illuminate the future of cities and society.
