Taking advantage of nearly 4 million transition records for three years in London from a popular location-based social network service, Foursquare, we study how to track the impact and measure the effectiveness of cultural investment in small urban areas. We reveal the underlying relationships between socio-economic status, local cultural expenditure, and network features extracted from user mobility trajectories. This research presents how geo-social and mobile services more generally can be used as a proxy to track local changes as government financial effort is put in developing urban areas, and thus gives evidence and suggestions for further policy-making and investment optimization.
