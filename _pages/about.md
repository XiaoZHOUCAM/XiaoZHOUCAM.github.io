I joined Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China as a tenure-track assistant professor in 2021. Prior to that, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the MIT Senseable City Lab. I hold a Ph.D. in computer science from University of Cambridge, UK, supervised by Professor Cecilia Mascolo. My research interest lies primarily in data mining, urban computing, human mobility, social network analysis, and multi-modal learning. I am particularly interested in applications of machine learning techniques in the social sciences, economics, and healthcare for more intelligent policy-making and mobile services.
