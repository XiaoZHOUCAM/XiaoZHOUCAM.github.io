I am currently a tenure-track Associate Professor at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Senseable City Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, supervised by Professor Cecilia Mascolo (FREng). My research focuses on data mining, urban computing, social computing, recommender systems, and large language models. Broadly, I am interested in developing AI-driven methods for the social sciences to enable more intelligent policy-making and human-centered mobile services.
